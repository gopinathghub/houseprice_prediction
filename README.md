# House price prediction using Linear regression and regularization techniques
> Linear regression model with Ridge and Lasso regularization techniques to predict hous prices

## General Information
### Problem Statement
A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has collected a data set 'train.csv' from the sale of houses in Australia. The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. We need to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.
